/**
 * Provides a template for writing tests for Roma.
 *
 * <h1>How to Write a Test for Roma</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * Writing a test for Roma is as simple as implementing this class.
 * When the tester runs, it will call your test's run method. The
 * parameters of this method contain a GameState, and a MoveMaker. You can
 * manipulate these to be in any legal state, and check it changes
 * correctly when you make a move. The GameState given will be be in
 * the initial Roma Game condition.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The tester will take care of printing a lot of information for you.
 * This includes your short description, so make sure it gives enough
 * information to show what the test is about. Also name your class
 * something appropriate, as this will also be printed. Any method you
 * call in the MoveMaker interface will also be printed, along with its
 * arguments.<br/>
 * If you do need to print miscellaneous information, <b> do not print
 * to {@code System.out}! </b> Instead, print to {@code this.out}. The
 * tester can then handle the printed text correctly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When you have written your test, either add it to the git repository
 * with a pull request, or email your tutorial acceptance
 * representative.
 * </p>
