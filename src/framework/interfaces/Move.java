 * When implementing, you can be confidant that any method called will
 * be valid for the present gameState, and so will not require data
 * validation by the game being tested. The author of a test is
 * required to ensure it is correct before including it in the testing
 * package. The final implementation of the testing framework will
 * perform a number of automatic sanity checks on each method.
